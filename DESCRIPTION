Description: Deconvolution of thermal decay curves allows you to quantify 
    proportions of biomass components in plant litter. Thermal decay curves
    derived from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) are imported, modified, and 
    then modelled in a three- or four- part  mixture model using the 
    Fraser-Suzuki function. The output is estimates for weights of 
    pseudo-components corresponding to hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin.
