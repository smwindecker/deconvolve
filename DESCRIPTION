Description: This package allows you to quantify proportion of biomass components 
    derived from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Mass loss data from TGA outputs 
    are imported, modified, and then modelled in a three- or four- part  mixture 
    model using the Fraser-Suzuki function. The output is estimates for weights 
    of pseudo-components corresponding to hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin.
