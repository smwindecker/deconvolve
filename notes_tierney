Notes from Tierney



juncus data - can you tell me where this data came from - was there a URL or a paper perhaps? -- where should this information go? I can link to biom



Package name: could you perhaps give the pkg name "deconvolve" a different name that included more of a spin on the type of data it uses? (some not good examples - "decarbonate", "detgangle" "detangletga")
